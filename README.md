# Early Disease Detection

This project aims to detect chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and more using machine learning models. It provides a web-based platform where users can input relevant health data and receive risk assessments for early detection.

## 🔍 Objective

To build an AI-powered system that assists in early diagnosis of chronic diseases using clinical data and machine learning algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

- Heart disease risk prediction (implemented)
- Extendable to other conditions like diabetes, ROP, etc.
- FastAPI-based RESTful API
- Modular code structure for easy extension
- Ready for deployment

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (Coming Soon)
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Scikit-learn, Pandas
- **Model:** Logistic Regression / CatBoost / RandomForest
- **Deployment:** Render / Netlify / Firebase (Planned)

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Git

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
 🧠 Future Scope
Add disease-specific modules (e.g. Diabetes, ROP detection)

Improve model performance using CatBoost and deep learning

Deploy with authentication and user dashboard
